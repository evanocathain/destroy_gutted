COMPILING
=========

destroy should compile by simply typing 'make'.



OUTPUT
======

The output of all 3 modes is: 

boxcar_option   time of pulse*            Comment
=============================================================
0,1,2           i+0.5                     For boxcar of size 1, this is the output for all options, for boxcars of 2 or larger it is ...
0               i*boxcar + 0.5*boxcar     This will always be an integer (boxcar always a power of 2 for option==0)
1               i + boxcar*0.5            This will always be an integer (boxcar always a power of 2 for option==1)
2               i + boxcar*0.5            As for option==1 for powers of 2, also always an integer for boxcars that are multiples of 2
                                          but will be at at N.5 values (where N is an integer) for odd values of the boxcar.

*  i.e. this is the time of the pulse when multiplied by tsamp,
   assuming that the 'time of pulse' for a one bin wide pulse in the
   first bin has a time of 0.5*tsamp after tstart

** i is zero indexed

Output Values
=============
0 -> N.5 for the boxcar==1 values, odd number for everything else
1 -> N.5 for the boxcar==1 values, odd or even integer for everything else
2 -> N.5 for the boxcar==1 values, odd or even integer values as for option==1 for powers of 2 and multiples of 2, N.5 for odd boxcars

Evan's To-Do List
=================

add in an option for boxcar steps to go in steps of 1.5x as well as the default 2x

change the hard-coded thresh<3.0 to thresh<-minsig, where minsig is the minimum time series value divided by sigma

add more _useful_comments and remove any needlessly commented out lines. make code shorter if possible anywhere
